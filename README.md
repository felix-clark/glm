# ndarray-glm

Rust library for solving linear, logistic, and generalized linear models through
iteratively reweighted least squares, using the `ndarray-linalg` module.

## Status

This package is in early alpha and the interface is likely to undergo many changes.

## Prerequisites
fortran and BLAS must be installed:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gfortran libblas-dev
```

To use the OpenBLAS backend, install also `libopenblas-dev` and use this crate with the "openblas-src" feature.

      distribution.
- [ ] Exact Z-scores by re-minimizing after fixing each parameter to zero
- [ ] Unit tests for correct convergence with linear offsets
